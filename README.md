## REQUIREMENTS
Since gw_example_plugin is a plugin that's buil to work with a Giswater project, you will need to have Giswater plugin installed. 

For more information about to getting started with Giswater<br> you can visit the README.md file of one the main repositories:

https://github.com/Giswater/docs<br>
https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_qgis_plugin.<br>
https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel.<br>

If you already have Giswater installed and active, you'll only need to install this plugin.

## INSTALL
In this point you will learn how to install gw_example_plugin.<br>

To install the plugin you will need to download the source code. You can download the .ZIP file directly from this repository. Once you have de .ZIP file you must extract it in the QGIS plugins folder*:

`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins`<br>

*This is the location of the QGIS plugins folder in Windows. The location may be diffrent in other operating systems.

After that you can open QGIS and a Giswater project and activate the plugin. To activate the plugin you must find _Plugins_ in the QGIS Menu Toolbar and then go to _Manage and Install Plugins_ > _Installed_ and click the checkbox for _giswater_plugin_example_.

## TEST
Here below you can find a video about how to get started working with _giswater_example_plugin_ and Python:<br>

## DEVELOPMENT

Once you have a project and both Giswater and gw_example_plugin acitvated you can start using the plugin.

This example plugin uses (__imports__) libraries from the Giswater plugin to work (**lib_*** and **tools_***). You can use _gw_example_plugin_ as a guide or starting point to learn how Giswater works and extend this example plugin with new buttons and functionalities. 

But more importantly, you can use the Giswater __libraries__ to create your own QGIS plugins, note that to import the Giswater libraries you must have Giswater plugin installed, but it is not mandatory to be activated in QGIS.
